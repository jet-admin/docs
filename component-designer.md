Component Designer has five distinct regions:&#x20;

1. **Toolbar** ‚Äì find tools to create frames, shapes, text, and other layers. These will be the building blocks of your designs.
2. **Parameters** ‚Äì allow you to pass dynamic variables from your app to the component
3. **Left sidebar** ‚Äì gives you access to layers. Explore any layers on the canvas.
4. **Canvas** ‚Äì is your working area where you‚Äôll arrange layers to create your designs. You‚Äôll find lots of room to explore and iterate on your ideas.
5. **Right sidebar** ‚Äì access more information about your designs. With a layer selected, you can explore the properties of your current selection.

### Component Responsiveness

Create responsive components using Resizing. Resizing allows you to handle the positioning and sizing of user elements when the size of the canvas changes. You can apply resizing to Canvas or Element.
