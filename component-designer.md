# üñç Component Designer

Design custom pixel-perfect components using Component Designer. Enabled to create, design, and modify their components with various options: creating components, providing states, giving styles, intuitive event handlers, seamless data connections (REST, GraphQL & Beyond), direct Figma & Sketch Imports.

### Customize your Components

If you're new to Component Designer, it's normal to feel lost when opening a file. We‚Äôll take you on a tour so you can orient yourself.

Component Designer has five distinct regions:&#x20;

1. **Toolbar** ‚Äì find tools to create frames, shapes, text, and other layers. These will be the building blocks of your designs.
2. **Parameters** ‚Äì allow you to pass dynamic variables from your app to the component
3. **Left sidebar** ‚Äì gives you access to layers. Explore any layers on the canvas.
4. **Canvas** ‚Äì is your working area where you‚Äôll arrange layers to create your designs. You‚Äôll find lots of room to explore and iterate on your ideas.
5. **Right sidebar** ‚Äì access more information about your designs. With a layer selected, you can explore the properties of your current selection.

### Conditional Visibility&#x20;

**Conditional Visibility** allows dynamic display adjustments of UI components or layers based on specified conditions. This feature is handy when you need UI elements to respond to changes, such as altering the color of a metric indicator depending on whether its value is positive or negative.

### Layout

**Layout** allows you to do the following operations:

* Adjusting Position (X and Y Coordinates)
* Modifying Width and Height
* Rotating elements
* Adjusting Corner Radius
* Flipping vertically over their X-axis and/or horizontally over the Y axis
* Set Element Opacity
* Blend modes (allow you to define how you want two layers to blend together)

### Fills

Paints are colors, gradients, or images. Fills are just one of the ways you can use paints in Jet.

Apply paints to text layers, or any vector object, this includes shapes, vector networks, and boolean groups. You can add, adjust, and remove fills in the **Fill** section of the right sidebar.

### Borders

### Apply shadow or blur effects

Effects serve several purposes, from aesthetic to functional. They can enable you to signify that an element is interactive, like making a button look clickable by giving the rectangle a shadow.

Blurs can shift and identify inactive or inaccessible elements, like thumbnails for unlocked game levels, or provide a visual hierarchy to focus a user's attention on a dialog box.

In Jet, there are four types of effects:

* Drop shadow
* Inner shadow
* Layer blur
* Background blur

Jet lets you add eight of each shadow effect, and one of each blur effect to a selection.

### Component Responsiveness / Constraints

Create responsive components using Resizing. Resizing allows you to handle the positioning and sizing of user elements when the size of the canvas changes. You can apply resizing to Canvas or Element.
