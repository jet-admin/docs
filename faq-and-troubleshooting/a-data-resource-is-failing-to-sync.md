  After editing in the structure of the database in the third-party integration
  source, such as Airtable, Firebase, Xano, Supabase, postgreSQL … etc, the sync
  with Jetadmin might fail sometimes.

# A data resource is failing to sync

To fix this you need to Recreate Scheme.

1- In Jetadmin, open the resource that is failing to sync;

2- Click on the 3 dots button on top-left near the resource name;

3- Choose ‘recreate scheme’ from the menu;

4- Click the ‘recreate structure’ red button;

5- Wait a few seconds till the data is being imported, then click the ‘Start working with …’ blue button.

Now your resource should be synced and working fine.&#x20;
