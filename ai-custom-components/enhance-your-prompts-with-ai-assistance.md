# Enhance Your Prompts with AI Assistance

### How to Use Enhance Prompting

1.  **Describe Your Component**\
    Write a short, clear description. Example:

    > "I want a product card with title, description and price."
2. **Click the Enhance Icon**\
   Hit the **Enhance (ðŸª„)** icon next to the Attach images icon.\
   Jet Admin rewrites your description into a detailed, build-ready prompt.
3. **Review and Edit (Optional)**\
   Check the enhanced prompt:
   * Adjust or expand if needed.
   * You can edit freely before submitting.
4. **Send to AI Builder**\
   When ready, submit the enhanced prompt to start building!

### ðŸ“‹ Best Practices

**Be Specific**: Mention important elements like layout type (card, form) or fields (title, price, image).

**Keep It Simple**: Write like you're explaining to a friend â€” no technical jargon needed.

**Clarify Special Needs**: If you need dynamic actions (e.g., click to open a modal), mention it in your prompt.
