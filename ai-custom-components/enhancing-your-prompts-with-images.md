### ðŸ“‹ Best Practices

**Always Add a Text Description**: Donâ€™t rely on the image alone â€” explain what matters most.

**Focus on Important Details**: Mention layout, colors, or key elements if they are important.

**Use Clear, High-Quality Images**: Avoid cluttered or blurry files for better results.
