### How to Upload and Improve Your Components

1. **Turn on Dev Mode First**
   * Click the **Dev** button inside your component to enable Developer Mode.
   * Only after turning on Dev Mode, youâ€™ll see these options:
     * **Upload Source Files** (upload individual files)
     * **Ask AI** (generate missing files)
     * **Extract .zip** (upload and extract full project archives)
2. **Upload Your Files or Extract a Project**
   * Upload your JSX, JavaScript, and CSS files individually.\
     **OR**
   * Upload a `.zip` file containing your full component structure (Jet Admin will extract it automatically).
3. **Use AI Assistance to Enhance the Uploaded Component**
   * After uploading, you can ask AI to:
     * Fix broken layouts
     * Generate missing actions or params
     * Improve design or logic
4. **Edit Freely in Dev Mode**
   * Edit files directly (layouts, styles, logic) to fine-tune your component.
5. **Download Your Component Files (Optional)**
   * Save and download your complete, improved component whenever needed.
6. **Save and Preview Changes Instantly**
   * Instantly preview how your updated component looks and behaves inside your app.
