# AI Custom Components

With Jet Admin’s **AI Custom Component**, you can design new UI components tailored exactly to your needs — no coding required. Just describe what you want in a chat format, and AI will generate custom components directly from your data. You can create anything from interactive sliders, maps, toggles, image carousels, and more.

Expect to iterate: you may need to refine your prompts or chat with the AI a few times to get the exact result you envision.

### **Enhance Your Prompts with AI Assistance**

Use Jet Admin’s **Enhance Prompting** feature to automatically improve your prompt before sending it to AI. Get clearer, more detailed instructions to generate better, more accurate custom components — faster and with less manual tweaking.

### Enhancing Your Prompts with Images

Want to reference an image? Click the image icon inside the prompt box to upload a file from your device. Make sure to also include a written prompt describing how you want the image to influence your component — this helps AI interpret your intent correctly.

### **Auto-Generate Parameters and Actions**

Jet Admin’s AI can automatically create the parameters and actions your custom component needs, based on your prompt. This means faster setup, smarter data binding, and ready-to-use interactions without manually configuring each field or action.
