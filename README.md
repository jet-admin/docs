## What is Jet Admin?

Jet Admin is an **app builder** that allows you to create **Client Portals**, **Business Apps**, and **Internal Tools** with your **existing data**, whether it's from databases, APIs, or Storages. You can build apps such as `Onboarding apps`, `Admin Panels`, `Vendor portals`, `CRMs`, and much more quickly and without code.
