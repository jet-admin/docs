# App Builder

In this Crash Course section, we'll learn the fundamentals of the App builder.

**App builder** is a core part of Jet Admin. It allows you to assemble your UI, and layout as well as bind and transform data to create custom user flows for your app. All this is done through an intuitive Drag & Drop and Point & Click interface.

Go into the submenu to navigate to a particular topic or start with the first one:

{% content-ref url="builder-and-user-modes.md" %}
[builder-and-user-modes.md](builder-and-user-modes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
