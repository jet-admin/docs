# Support multi-screens

Responsiveness and support of multi-screens refers to the ability of a design to adapt and display optimally across various devices and screen sizes. It ensures a seamless user experience by adjusting layout and content to accommodate different resolutions, promoting accessibility and usability.

To fit your component to different screen sizes, follow the steps:

1. Click to fix the width for the text component.
2. Go to the resizing section in the **Right Sidebar**.
3. Fix the borders for the text.
