# Set the Layout

Jet Admin provides the library of pre-built **UI components**, such as `Table`, `Map`, `Gallery`, or `Charts` that you can **drag and drop** to display your data. As well as the `Layout` components that are used to assemble other components on the page.

### Set the Layout

`Columns` are used to set the horizontal component of the layout. You can add multiple columns and resize them:

### Set the Title

You can use **static** components in Jet Admin, such as `Text` or `Image`. Text appearance can be adjusted:

Next, let's **display** our customers in the `Table` view:

{% content-ref url="display-customers.md" %}
[display-customers.md](display-customers.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
