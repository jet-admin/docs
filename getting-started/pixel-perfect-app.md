Creating custom components for your Pixel Perfect App through Component Designer is a meticulous process that requires thoughtful design to seamlessly integrate with your application's visual appeal. Let's go through the step-by-step design adventure:

### **1. Design your component**&#x20;

**1.1 Choose Component Type**

Identify the type of component you want to create, whether it's a button, card, or any other UI element.

After creating the design, you need to bind it with the table data.&#x20;



### **3. Conditional visibility (Component Visibility, Conditional Fills)**
