# Generate the App

### Connect your Data Source

After creating a project, you'll be prompted to start with the Blank app or your Data. Select your chosen Data Source, fill in the credentials, and finish the process.

1. Click on the `Data Source` icon
2. Click on the `Add Resource` icon
3. Choose **Airtable**

### Choose the Page

You can **navigate through** pages and **create new** ones in the top left tab. Now,  let's pick another page:

1. Click on the Pages icon
2. Choose and Navigate to the Page

{% @arcade/embed flowId="b2ownQCQUDzU1CFsdcNx" url="https://app.arcade.software/share/b2ownQCQUDzU1CFsdcNx" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When you connect a Database, Jet Admin automatically **generates an app** based on the pages you selected in the previous step
{% endhint %}

Now let's **test** how it works by&#x20;

1. Clicking on the `Table` to select it
2. Clicking on a `Row` to drill down to the record view

Next, let's set up **the Layout**:

{% content-ref url="set-the-layout.md" %}
[set-the-layout.md](set-the-layout.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
