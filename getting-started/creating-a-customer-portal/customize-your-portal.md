# Customize your Portal

In Jet Admin, you can **customize the appearance** of your Portal for better usability. Let's start with the `Units` table.

**Let's disable** unnecessary columns and **rearrange** the order.

1. Click on the **Units Table**
2. Disable the unnecessary columns

{% hint style="info" %}
In Airtable, field types are detected automatically, but for other data sources you might need to configure them by clicking on the **column icon**
{% endhint %}

Let's now set the number of **displayed rows** to **5**, and make the first row selected by default. To do that, follow the steps:

1. Go to the **Display Tab**
2. Set 5 in the **Rows Per Table** section
3. Enable the **Select First Row By Default** option

You can change the **field types** to render different fields differently and customize their appearance. To do so,

1. Click on the **Priority** field
2. Choose **Low Option**
3. Click on the **Color** field
4. Choose the Color

In Jet Admin, you can configure and customize **any component individually on any page**. Let's make our record fields non-editable so that the users will be able to change them.

1. Click on the **Unit ID** field
2. From the menu on the right, change it to **Editable**
3. Click on the Assign To ID field
4. From the menu on the right, change it to **View-Only**

Applying similar edits to the `Tasks` table and we're done with the UI customization.

Now, let's invite external users and make them interact **only with their data:**

{% content-ref url="invite-users.md" %}
[invite-users.md](invite-users.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
