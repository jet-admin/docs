# Prepare your Data

You can build Portals with data from pretty much **Any Data Source**: `Firebase, Sheets`, `Airtable`, `Stripe`, `REST API`, and so on. We'll use **Airtable** in our example.

In our case, we will use two tables: Projects and Tasks. **The projects** table has the `Link to Tasks` column and the **Tasks** have the `Project` column in it.

**Projects Table:**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (807).png>)

**Tasks Table:**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (808).png>)

Next, we **generate the app**:

{% content-ref url="generate-the-ui.md" %}
[generate-the-ui.md](generate-the-ui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
