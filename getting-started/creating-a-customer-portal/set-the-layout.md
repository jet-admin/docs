# Set the Layout

Jet Admin provides a library of pre-built **UI components**, such as `Table`, `Map`, `Gallery`, or `Charts` that you can **drag and drop** to display your data. As well as the `Layout` components that are used to assemble other components on the page.

### Set the Layout

`Columns` are used to set the horizontal component of the layout. You can add multiple columns and resize them.&#x20;

To add columns, follow the steps:

1. From the Layout menu, drag and drop **Columns**
2. **Drag and Drop** the Tasks Table in the **Right Column**
3. **Drag and Drop** a Form in the **Left Column**

We also can change the position of the individual fields in the record view. For that, drill down into the record and drag and drop the fields you want to reassemble:

{% @arcade/embed flowId="I3gyu8LesPigQCpUxvxk" url="https://app.arcade.software/share/I3gyu8LesPigQCpUxvxk" %}

Now, let's add our `Project` table and link it to the `Tasks` table:

{% content-ref url="link-related-table.md" %}
[link-related-table.md](link-related-table.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
