# Nested Filters

Nested filters allow you to filter data from multiple related collections. For instance, if you have a Contact collection that is linked to a Company collection through the `company_id` field, you can use **Nested filters** to filter your Contacts based on the properties of the related Companies. This means you can filter the Contact collection by company's properties like company size, status, and so on. With nested filters, you have the flexibility to dig deep and filter through unlimited levels of related collections.
