# ðŸŽ¨ Design & Structure

### Customizing Pages

A Page is an interface element that can span across various use cases. Create pages from scratch or generate an Admin Panel to get your application ready in less than 2 minutes.

{% content-ref url="pages.md" %}
[pages.md](pages.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Filters (built-in)

Every table in your Jet app has built-in filtering functions. There are two ways to access these:

1. By the filter icon on the upper right of the table.
2. By _Filter by field_ optio&#x6E;_._

{% content-ref url="filter.md" %}
[filter.md](filter.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Sort

You can sort your data or set a default sorting.

{% content-ref url="sort.md" %}
[sort.md](sort.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Group

You can group your data to display on charts.

{% content-ref url="group.md" %}
[group.md](group.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Actions

Action is an operation that you can perform in Jet Admin. Visually, the action is a button in the Jet Admin interface.

{% content-ref url="actions.md" %}
[actions.md](actions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
