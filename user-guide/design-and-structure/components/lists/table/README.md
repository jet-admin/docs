On top of it, you can customize each field individually, for example, change the name of a column or change the field type:

### Selection function

Any `table` in Jet Admin has the `selected row` function that can be used to trigger all sorts of actions as well as fetching values from selected records:

### Grouping Rows in Tables

Jet Admin lets you group table rows together to better organize your data.

To do this, go to the Display section and scroll down to 'Group By'.

Choose the field to group rows by, enter a label for each group, and pick a color to highlight the groups.

### Hiding Filters from Filter

Hiding fields lets you only show preferred filters in the list.

Go to 'Display Filters' and you can disable all filters, which removes the filter icon completely.

Or choose to hide some filters by clicking the toggle button next to each one.
