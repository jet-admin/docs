# Timeline

A timeline is a list that depicts how a set of resources are used over time. If you're managing a software project and want to illustrate who is doing what and when, or if you're organizing a conference and need to schedule meeting rooms, a timeline is often a reasonable visualization choice.

### Timeline data settings

Once you have added your resource and performed an SQL or API request to your resource, or selected a collection from the list, you need to configure the Timeline display.

For example, you need to display a timeline for upcoming events, simply select the collection from your resource and set a date field.
