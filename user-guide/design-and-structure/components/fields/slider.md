**Functionality:**

* **Range Selection:** Users can click and drag the blue circular handle along the slider track to choose a value within the specified range.
* **Adjustable Min/Max Values (Builder Controlled):** The builder can dynamically change the minimum and maximum values based on other values or conditions. Users cannot change these values within the app.
* **Default Range:** Builder can also change the default set range to fit specific requirements.
* **Visual Feedback:** The position of the handle provides visual feedback on the current selected value.

**Usage:**

This component is typically used in forms or settings where users need to specify a value within a certain range, such as setting the intensity of a filter, adjusting volume, or selecting a rating. While users interact with the slider to select values, builders can adjust the minimum, maximum, and default values to tailor the component to various contexts and requirements.

## Settings

You can set label, current value, minimum and maximum value to depict range, and also step size and color.

It is possible to set the current value, range, and step size using Formula.
