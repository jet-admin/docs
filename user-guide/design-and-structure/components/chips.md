# Chips

### Usage

Chips are ideal for categorizing, filtering, or inputting data. They can dynamically display options, allowing users to add new chips and interact with the component.

### Customization

#### Custom Styling

You can modify the shapes of chips to fit your application's theme.

#### Adding Options

Enable the **Allow Adding Options** checkbox to let users add new chips dynamically.

#### Actions

The Chips component supports specifying actions that can be triggered by user interactions. You can define actions for the following events:

* **Top Actions**: Actions that appear at the top of the component.
* **Bottom Actions**: Actions that appear at the bottom of the component.
* **Value Changes**: Actions that trigger when the value of the chips changes.
