The Accordion component enhances your application's user experience by allowing users to show and hide related content sections on a page. This feature is perfect for organizing content in a compact, efficient manner, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need. For example, users can quickly find answers to their questions in a FAQ section without scrolling through all the content.&#x20;

**Configuration Options**

* **Add Multiple Sections**: Easily add multiple sections within the Accordion to categorize and organize related content effectively. Each section can have its own header and content, allowing for a structured and detailed presentation of information.
* **Allow Opened Sections**: Enable or disable the ability for multiple sections to be opened simultaneously. When this feature is enabled, users can view multiple sections at once, providing a comprehensive view of the content. If disabled, only one section can be open at a time, keeping the interface clean and focused.
* **Opened/Closed Indicator**: Include visual indicators to show whether a section is opened or closed. These indicators enhance user experience by providing clear, immediate feedback on the state of each section, making it easy to navigate through the content.
