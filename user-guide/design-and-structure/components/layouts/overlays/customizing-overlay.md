# Customizing Overlay

You can customize your overlays with options like showing a close button and allowing it to close when the user clicks outside of it.

1. Open the Overlay settings
2. Disable the **Show Close Button**
3. Disable the **Close On Background click**

Those settings can be beneficial if you want to build an overlay that has crucial information and requires the user to perform an action before they can continue. The actual closing of the overlay can be then managed via buttons or workflows inside the overlay.
