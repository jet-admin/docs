# Alert

## Customization

Customization is at the heart of the Alert component. You can easily modify the appearance by adding icons and adjusting colors to match your application's theme. Optional titles provide a concise summary of the alert's purpose, enhancing user understanding. Additionally, you can incorporate links to trigger actions or queries, making the alerts interactive and actionable.
