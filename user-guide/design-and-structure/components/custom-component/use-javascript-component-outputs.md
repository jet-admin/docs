# Use JavaScript Component Outputs

You can specify **Outputs** to take from your JavaScript Component and use their values in other **Jet Admin** components**.** For such cases, you should set **Outputs** inside your JavaScript Component by sending **CustomEvent** with **Output** name and its value in the **detail** field (Examples from GitHub include it already).

Then you can create **Output** set its name and use it for other components (for example set **Text Field** value to JavaScript Component **Output**).
