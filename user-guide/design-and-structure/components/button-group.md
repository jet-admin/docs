# Button Group

The Button Group component is simply easing the process of aligning and organizing a group of buttons' layout vertically or horizontally. Each button has it's own actions, and nothing functionally ties it up with other buttons except the layout.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

### Button Group's Orientation

In the Button group's properties, you can set the buttons' layout horizontally or vertically depending on the design you need.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

### Button Group's  Actions

There are no actions for the Button Group container. It functions as just a container. however you can add [actions ](../actions.md)to each button inside it separately.  For example, you can add actions such as Run Operations, Export Data, Open an overlay, Copy to clipboard, Send an email, Run a workflow, Navigate to a page and others.
