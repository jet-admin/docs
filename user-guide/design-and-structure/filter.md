# Filtering

Every table in your Jet app has built-in filtering functions. There are two ways to access these:

1. Click on the filter icon on the upper right of the table.
2. Click on the field you want to filter at the top of the table and choose _Filter by field._

In both of these cases, it is necessary to choose the logical expression for filtering and then type in the value that you wish to use for the filter. If you want to create a filter that provides a list of values to choose from, [add a filter component.](https://docs.jetadmin.io/user-guide/design-and-structure/components/filters)

### Filter your collection

You can also use the same built-in filtering tools in the Data Editor. The process is the same, the only difference is that the filter button is on the upper left of the Data Editor instead of being on the upper right.
