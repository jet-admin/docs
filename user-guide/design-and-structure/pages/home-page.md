# Home Page

You can set one or more home pages for your app. There are three options for setting a home page: default to the first page in your menu, select a specific page, or set up a workflow to send users to different pages based on conditions.

To access home page settings, use the _Pages_ menu on the left of the screen.

When you select **Using workflow**, the beginning of the workflow will be created automatically to send new users, invited users, and returning users to different home pages. You can use these conditions or set your own.
