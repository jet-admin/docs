# Select

Select field is ideal when you want to be able to select a single option from a predefined list of options. You can select the required option from the drop-down menu, or just type to narrow down the list of options.&#x20;

You can add, delete, edit and specify colors for each select option in the Visual Builder. For example, you want to add a `select` field of priorities. You just need to add select options by specifying `Display Value` and `Database Value`.

You can also obtain selec options from your resource. For example, you have a `priority` column in your data source, just select the options type `Dynamic from Resource` then choose collection from which you want to obtain the options.
