# Buttons

Buttons are the execution of any action. For example, you can create buttons to execute: Copy to clipboard, Send an email, Open a link, Link to page and others.

### Adding button

To add a button, you need to go to Visual Builder and simply drag and drop the Action to the page, specify the button name and action type. More information about types of [Actions](../design-and-structure/actions.md).

### Send an email button

For example, you want to add a button that will send emails. To do this, select the type of Action - **Run Operation**, and then configure the action to send an email (example below: using Sendgrid to do this). For more details about how to set up Actions, see [here.](https://docs.jetadmin.io/user-guide/design-and-structure/actions)
