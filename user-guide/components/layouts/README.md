# Layouts

Containers help you organize your page structure. For instance, you need to structure the data on the page into columns or sections.

### Page customization with container

For example, you want to add your charts or any components to columns:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/GIF (239).gif>)



### Container types

We have 4 types of containers: card, columns, tabs and sections. You can combine them with each other to build a page structure.
