# Single value

Single value charts are good for displaying your KPIs, such as the average number of orders per day, monthly revenue, etc.

After selecting your dataset, you will need to choose what you want the chart to display (e.g. sum of field, maximum of field, ...) and apply any filters you may wish to use.\

Single value charts also allow you to show comparisons and trends.

### Trends

Adding a trend display – which will appear as a small line chart – can be done by clicking on **Add trend chart** in the Single Value chart menu. Then, you will need to set up the trend chart by choosing the desired dataset, what exact data to show, how to group the data, and add any filters you might want.

### Comparisons

Comparisons show the percent change between the Single Value and another value of your choice. One example of this would be to use the same data for both the Single Value and the comparison, but to add a _Previous Month_ filter to the comparison data.

To set up a comparison, click on **Add comparison** in the Single Value chart menu. Then, you will need to choose the desired dataset, what exact data to use for the comparison, and add any filters you might want.
