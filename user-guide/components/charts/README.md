# Charts

Charts let you display and track global KPIs on the dashboard as well as provide at-a-glance performance insights. It's the fastest way to create analytical reports on your data.&#x20;

In Jet Admin, you can visualize your data as any of the following chart widgets: **line**, **bar**, **pie** and **doughnut charts**, **single value**.

### Datasets

Once you selected the chart type you need to add and configure dataset, simply click **+Add Dataset** and select the resource from which the chart will be built.&#x20;

When you set up your chart, you need to select which data will be displayed. For example, you want to display the growth of subscribers by date. To do this, select the appropriate fields for display and grouping:

### Multiple datasets

To display several datasets simultaneously add multiple datasets on one chart.

This is what multiple datasets on the same chart look like. You can specify different colors for each dataset.

### Formatting data

You can format the display of your Y-axis data. For example, the numbers of your data are very small, so you can limit the display area. Set the limiting (minimum and maximum) values in this field:

Here we set the minimum and maximum values to change the chart display area.

Another common use case for data formatting is displaying data in a currency when you hover over a chart. To change the way data is displayed in a chart, click on the chosen resource in the chart menu to access data display options.&#x20;

Then, click on the Display button in the resource's menu. Finally, in the Tooltip Format field, enter the format that you want the information to be displayed in (for example, $0.00).
