# Gallery

A gallery is great for displaying your items in a visually appealing and easy to comprehend way.&#x20;

<div data-full-width="true">

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

### Gallery data settings

For example, you have a database with product photos, you can display it in the gallery component. Simply select a resource and collection and configure the display:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/GIF (227).gif>)

More information about Data & Display Settings, Search and Action you can find in our documentation.

### Group by field

**Group by field** allows you to organize and display your visual content in a more structured and meaningful way.

* **Dynamic Organization**: Automatically group your gallery items based on any field, such as category, date, or custom tags, making it easier for users to navigate and find what theyâ€™re looking for.
* **Customizable Display**: Tailor the appearance of each group with customizable headers, separators, and styling options, ensuring your gallery aligns perfectly with your app's design.
