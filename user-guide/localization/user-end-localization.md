# User-end Localization

Jet's localization settings allow you to manage time zone discrepancies between the input and displayed values. This feature proves beneficial when dealing with users in multiple time zones, as they can operate with dates and times based on a chosen time zone while maintaining the original time zone of the values (such as UTC).

### Setting up the language

#### Step 1: Go to App Settings

Inside the app builder, use the menu on the left to navigate to **App Setting**.

In the menu on the right, in the **Appearance** section (the first one, which opens up by default), **scroll down** to the bottom to get to the **Language & Region** section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If **your language is not on the list**, reach out to our support (bottom left corner in the app) to request adding your language. You can submit new localizations or edits to the existing ones on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jet-admin/jet-localization).
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2: Pick the language that you want to set as the default language for your app and save the changes

Once you save the changes, all the users who sign up/log in into the app (in the user mode) will see the localized version.
