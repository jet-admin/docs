# Bearer Token

**Use API keys** if you expect developers to build internal applications that don’t need to access more than a single user’s data.

**Bearer authentication** is an authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected resources:

```
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
```

Adding an API that uses a bearer token authentication scheme is easy in Jet Admin. Just add it as a global header in the Resource configuration screen and all your API requests that use the resource will have the right auth headers sent over.
