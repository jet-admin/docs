Intercom provides you with an Access Token as soon as you [create an app](https://app.intercom.com/a/developer-signup) on your workspace. You can find your Access Token in the **Configure > Authentication** section in your app within the [Developer Hub](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/\_/developer-hub/app-packages).
