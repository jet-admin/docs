# Gmail

The Gmail integration allows you to connect your Google Mail account as a data source in JetAdmin. Once connected, you can view and query Gmail data like Messages, Labels, Drafts, and Threads, and run email-related actions such as adding labels, archiving, or forwarding messages.\
This makes it easy to integrate your email workflow directly into your JetAdmin apps, agents and automations.

#### Steps

1. **Go to Data Settings:**\
   In your JetAdmin app, open **Data → Add Resource**.
2. **Select Gmail:**\
   From the list of available data sources, choose **Gmail**.
3. **Name your resource (optional):**\
   Give your Gmail connection a custom name such as _Support Inbox_ or _Sales Emails_.
4. **Sign in to Google:**\
   A pop-up window will appear. Sign in with your Google account and grant JetAdmin access to your Gmail data.
5. **Complete the connection:**\
   After a successful connection, JetAdmin automatically imports four main collections and several inbox-related actions.
