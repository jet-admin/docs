# Google Calendar

The Google Calendar integration lets you add your calendar as a data source in JetAdmin. Once connected, you’ll have access to your Events, as well as actions like Get free/busy information and Quick add event.\
This allows you to query, view, and interact with calendar data just like any other JetAdmin resource.

#### Steps

1. **Open the Data section:**\
   Go to **Data → Add Resource** in your JetAdmin app.
2. **Select Google Calendar:**\
   From the list of available resources, choose **Google Calendar**.
3. **Name your resource (optional):**\
   Enter a custom name for your connection for example, _Team Calendar_ or _Marketing Schedule_.
4. **Sign in to Google:**\
   A pop-up window will appear. Log in using your Google account and grant JetAdmin permission to access your calendars.
5. **Choose your calendar:**\
   Select which calendar you want to connect (for example, your primary calendar or a shared team calendar).
6. **Done – connection complete:**\
   Once connected, JetAdmin will automatically generate:
   * **Events table** – displays all events from your selected calendar.
   * **Get free/busy information** – check calendar availability for a given time range.
   * **Quick add event** – create new calendar events instantly.
