# Docker Installation

Integrate our [Jet Bridge](../../../jet-bridge-deployment/jet-admin/) plugin with Docker installation in one command. You can place it behind your VPN, in your own VPC, and works locally. We wonâ€™t get access to your data, however, you will still receive updates normally.

#### Requirements:

* Docker installed
* localhost or web server with an external IP

#### Installation:

1\. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and make sure it works correctly.

2\. Install Jet Bridge container by running:&#x20;

```bash
sh <(curl -s https://app.jetadmin.io/install_jet.sh) {{Project Name}} {{Token}}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**{Project Name} and {Token}** is automatically generated when you connect **Resource**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using **Jet Bridge** just for HTTP requests (and not SQL) you can use **Project Token** as value for {Token}.
{% endhint %}

Go to the API key and below the API keys

****![](../../../.gitbook/assets/api.jpg)****

Copy **UNIQUE APP NAME** and **JET BRIDGE TOKEN.**

3\.  Finish your project installation by opening in your browser:\
**localhost** is your **Jet Bridge** HOST and **8888** is its PORT.

```bash
http://localhost:8888/api/register/
```
