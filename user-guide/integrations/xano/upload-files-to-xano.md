# Upload files to Xano

If you have an **/upload/attachment** endpoint in your Xano API, you will see two sections when viewing your Xano data resource: Collections and Storages. Collections is for the Xano tables with your data, and Storages is where your files are kept on Xano.

**Upload to Xano as an App Builder**

You can upload files to Xano from the Jet Admin's app builder with no further setup – simply go to **Attachments** in the Storages section of your Xano resource, click on **Upload File** in the upper right corner, and choose the file you wish to upload.

**Allow App Users to Upload to Xano**

You can allow your app users to upload files to Xano by using a **File Picker** form. Drag and drop it into your app, then set it up by choosing the Output Format **Save to Storage** and choosing Xano as the storage that you want to upload the file to.
