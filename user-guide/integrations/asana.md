# Asana

The Asana integration lets you bring your project management data directly into JetAdmin. After connecting your workspace, you can view and query your Asana items such as Projects, Tasks, Tags, Teams, and Users, and trigger powerful actions like creating tasks, adding comments, or updating task followers.\
This allows you to build streamlined workflows, dashboards, and automations based on your Asana data.

#### Steps

1. **Go to Data Settings:**\
   In your JetAdmin workspace, open **Data → Add Resource**.
2. **Select Asana:**\
   Choose **Asana** from the list of available data sources.
3. **Name your resource (optional):**\
   Give your connection a custom name such as _Project Management_ or _Marketing Team Tasks_.
4. **Sign in to Asana:**\
   You have two authentication options:
   * **Google Sign-In (OAuth):** Sign in with your Google account connected to Asana.
   * **Token Authentication:** Enter your Asana Personal Access Token.
5. **Choose your Workspace:**\
   Select the Asana workspace you want JetAdmin to connect to.
6. **Add Resource:**\
   JetAdmin will verify the connection. Once successful, your Asana data and actions will be imported automatically.

**Useful Tips**\
• Use **Search Tasks** to filter by assignee, status, or keywords inside JetAdmin.\
• Automate repetitive actions (e.g., create a task when a new support ticket arrives).\
• Use **Add Comment** or **Add Followers** actions to keep teams informed without switching to Asana.\
• If you work across multiple workspaces, you can connect each as a separate resource for clearer organization.
