# Firestore

If you select a Firestore database, you'll be prompted to choose the **connection mode**.

Here, you must choose how you'd like your Firestore to integrate with Jet Admin. You can connect directly or sync it with Jet's internal database to get extended functionality.&#x20;

If you want to be able to **combine** your **Firestore data** with data from other data sources, such as Google Sheets, Airtable, or even REST API within the same tables, you should choose the **"Sync" connection**. You can learn more about it here:

[data-blending.md](../../data-blending.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

After having connected your Firestore, you'll be prompted to choose collections you want Jet Admin to generate **an admin panel (CRUD pages)** for. If you don't want an admin panel to be generated at all, leave all the boxes empty.

You can also watch our video on Firebase to learn how to quickly build **admin panels** or **CRUD apps** with Firebase:&#x20;
