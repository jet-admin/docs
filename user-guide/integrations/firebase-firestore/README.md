# Firebase

In this article, we'll review the integration with Firebase, and its characteristics, and will go through the steps necessary to connect it to Jet Admin

### Connecting Firebase

You can connect to Firebase from the new app flow, from the data tab on the left menu bar, or from the data section within a UI component.

Then, you'll need to provide a **service token** to allow your Firebase to interact with Jet. You can either copy and paste a JSON snippet (1) or upload it as a file (2):

Further steps vary based on the type of database you want to connect to: Firestore or Realtime DB. Please check the pages below for each type:

{% content-ref url="firestore.md" %}
[firestore.md](firestore.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="realtime-database.md" %}
[realtime-database.md](realtime-database.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
