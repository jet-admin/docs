# Zoom

The Zoom integration lets you bring your video conferencing data directly into Jet Admin. After connecting your account, you can view and query Zoom resources such as **Users, Meetings, Webinars, Recordings, and Participants**, and trigger powerful actions like **creating or updating meetings, managing registrants, retrieving participants, or deleting recordings**.

This allows you to build streamlined **admin panels, dashboards, and automations** based on your Zoom data.

#### Steps

1. **Go to Data Settings:**\
   In your JetAdmin workspace, open **Data → Add Resource**.
2. **Select Zoom:**\
   Choose **Zoom** from the list of available data sources.
3. **Name your resource (optional):**\
   Give your connection a custom name such as _Project Meetings_.
4. **Sign in to Zoom:**\
   Sign in with your Zoom account
5. **Add Resource:**\
   JetAdmin will verify the connection. Once successful, your Zoom data and actions will be imported automatically.
