# Steps

**Steps** consist of **actions**, which run in a sequential manner when a workflow is triggered, and **rules**, which allow you to branch the sequence based on certain conditions. An example of an action would be "Updating a record in Airtable" and an example of a rule could be "If condition" that will divide a workflow into two branches.&#x20;

Rule steps allow you to run alternative or simultaneous sequences based on specific conditions.
