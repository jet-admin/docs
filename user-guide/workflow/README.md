# ⚙️ Workflow

As the company is growing and the roles are diversifying, the need for some sort of a task management system for your internally-facing applications is increasing. So we came up with the **Approval Workflow** feature.

{% content-ref url="task-approval.md" %}
[task-approval.md](task-approval.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

In JetAdmin you can create **Actions Workflow** that allow you to perform multiple actions immediately after performing the base action.

{% content-ref url="actions-workflow.md" %}
[actions-workflow.md](actions-workflow.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Create a **sequence of actions** in Zapier or Integromat by triggering through JetAdmin actions.

{% content-ref url="action-sequences.md" %}
[action-sequences.md](action-sequences.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
