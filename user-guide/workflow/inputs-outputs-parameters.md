# Inputs, Outputs, Parameters

Many cases that include workflows, especially the more complex ones, require you to be able to pass values **from the app into the builder** as well as pass values **from the builder into the app**.

A **simple example** would be a workflow that deletes a record and sends an email notification via Mailchimp:&#x20;

**To achieve that**, we'll need to fetch the `ID` (to identify what record to delete) and pass it into the "Orders - Delete" action in the workflow. We'll also need to pass the customer's email into the Mailchimp action (so that the notification is sent to the right person)

{% hint style="info" %}
The **ID** (primary key), is a unique identifier of a record, which could be set in the data source, auto-generated by Jet, or set manually in Jet (depending on the data source). It is typically hidden in the table but available for the fetching and referencing in other components
{% endhint %}

There are two ways how we can **fetch** the `ID` from the selected row:

1. **Directly from the Step**
2. **Through the Workflow Parameters**

### **Directly from the Step**

Select the step **(1)** then click on the ID and click on "Formula" **(2)**.

{% hint style="info" %}
All the imputs available will be listed in the configuration menue on teh right for a given Step
{% endhint %}

### Through the Parameters

**Parameters** allow you to receive and hold different values from the app so that they can be referenced and used in the workflow steps.

**To add** a parameter, either go to the **trigger action menu**:

Or open the workflow builder and click on the trigger action step there:

After that, **go back to the trigger action menu** (close the workflow builder), select teh created parameter **(1)** and reference any dynamic value from the app **(2)**.

This will put the referenced value into the parameter. Then, you can fetch the stored dynamic from the parameter within an action step:

**Outputs** allow you to fetch and store the results from specific steps in the automation. You can later reference those outputs from within the app.&#x20;

You can use the **last step** outputs (default) **(1)** or specify the outputs manually **(2)** so that you can get the results from the specific steps **(3)**.

You can go futher and **combine and transform** results using the functions modal:
