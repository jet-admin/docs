# Triggers

To start building automation, **select the trigger** which will initiate it. Triggers can be broadly divided into three categories:&#x20;

* **Buttons**
* **List actions**
* **Success/Error actions**

### Buttons

The most common one is `button`. To create an automation,&#x20;

1. Click on the `Click action`
2. Choose `Run Workflow`&#x20;

### List Actions

You can also create automation for any of the **list actions**. The lists include `Table`, `Map`, `Kanban`, `Gallery`, `Timeline`, and `Calendar`.

### Success/Error actions

Another type of action that can trigger workflows is `Success/Error.` To specify them, follow the steps:

1. Go to the `Actions Tab`
2. Specify them one by one **by clicking on the buttons**
