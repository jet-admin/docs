# Sync Connection

While connecting a data source, you'll be prompted to choose the type of connection, there could be a **direct connection** or a **sync connection**:

Choose the sync connection to unlock all the features listed above. Under the hood, it will use Jet Tables - Jet's built-in SQL database as the medium for syncing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the moment, the sync connection is available for a **limited number of integrations**. If you want us to prioritize a specific data source, please let us know in the support chat
{% endhint %}
