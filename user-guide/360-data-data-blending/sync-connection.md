# Sync Connection

While connecting a data source, you'll be prompted to choose the type of connection, there could be a **direct connection** or a **sync connection**:

Choose the sync connection to unlock all the features listed above. Under the hood, it will use Jet Tables - Jet's built-in SQL database as the medium for syncing.

To sync a connection, follow the steps:

1. Click on the `More` icon
2. Click on the `Sync Structure` button
