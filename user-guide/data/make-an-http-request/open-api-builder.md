# Open API Builder

You can open the API Builder directly from the component simply by selecting the Rest API resource. The API Builder will be opened automatically in case you do not create any collections yet, otherwise, you will need to select Make HTTP Request from the list of collections for your Rest API resource.

To open the API Builder from the table, follow the steps:

1. From the **Right Menu** add a table to the page
2. Click on the `Collection` button to change it
3. Choose **Rest API** as a collection
4. Click on the `Table` button to change it

### Pass Values to API Builder

1. Fill in the corresponding value of the key in the column **Value**
2. Click on the `Run` button to **send a request**
3. Click on the Save button to **save it**
