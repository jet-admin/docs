# Multi-Editing and Bulk Actions

The new Data Editor allows you to manage multiple records using simple checkboxes. You can select individual rows or several at once and apply common actions directly, helping you work faster and keep your data organized.

#### Steps

1. **Select records:** Use the checkbox on the left side of each row to select one or multiple records.
2. **Apply bulk actions:** Once records are selected, the action bar will appear at the top of the table.
3. **Duplicate selected rows:** Click **Duplicate** to instantly create copies of the selected records. New rows will appear with the same field values.
4. **Export selected rows:** Click **Export** to download only the selected records. You can export in different formats.
5. **Delete selected rows:** Click **Delete** to remove the selected records from your table. A confirmation step helps prevent accidental deletion.
6. **Deselect all:** Use the top checkbox in the header row to quickly select or deselect all visible records.
