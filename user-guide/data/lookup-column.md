# Lookup Column

A lookup field allows you to pull record contents from one linked record into another linked record. With a lookup column, you can retrieve information from any specified column as long as a relation column exists for that table.

To create a lookup column, head to the [Data Editor](./) and add a new column. Choose “**Lookup related field**” from the column types and choose the relation column that best fits your query. Once you’ve chosen a relation column, choose which column you want to pull data from.
