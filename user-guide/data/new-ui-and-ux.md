# New UI & UX

The new Data Editor introduces a modern, spreadsheet-like experience designed for flexibility and productivity. You can now easily customize field views, organize columns, and view detailed information in one place, all without leaving your table view.

#### Key Features

**Reorder and Organize Fields**

Drag and drop columns to instantly rearrange your table layout. Customize your workspace by keeping the most important fields visible and moving less-used ones out of the way.

**Pin and Hide Fields**

Keep critical fields always in view by pinning them to the left side of your table. You can also hide unused fields without deleting them, hidden fields stay available in the background and can be restored anytime.

**View Full Cell Details**

Double-click any cell to open its full details. This lets you inspect long text, JSON, or other complex data values in a focused view without leaving your view.

**Spreadsheet-Like Editing**

Select multiple cells, drag values across rows (like in Spreadsheet), or quickly duplicate field values. The editor feels familiar yet much more powerful.
