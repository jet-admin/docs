# Syncing Schema and Data

If you make any changes to your schema or data, such as adding new tables or fields, this will not appear immediately in Jet. Run a manual sync directly in Jet to see the changes.

## Run Schema Sync <a href="#run-schema-sync-0-0" id="run-schema-sync-0-0"></a>

Jet automatically syncs the schema structure every **24 hours**, you can manually run a schema sync as an admin whenever you need in order to see changes reflected straight away.



## Run Data sync <a href="#run-data-sync-0-1" id="run-data-sync-0-1"></a>
