# If → Then → Else Column

The If → Then → Else Column allows you to produce a new set of data for your app based on a set of conditions.

This is great for assigning a status for an item in your app once it meets certain criteria.

Take a look at this example:

Once an interviewer assigns a score to an applicant in this app, the If → Then → Else column will automatically assign a status for the applicant - passed or failed.
