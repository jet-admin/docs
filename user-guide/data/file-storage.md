# File Storage and Uploading

You can easily view any storages you have on databases and upload new files to them using Jet Admin. Jet Admin also has built-in storage that gives you up to 20GB of storage allowance for all kinds of files, including images, videos, documents & pdfs.&#x20;

Some integrated resources require additional setup on the resource side to give Jet access to storages. To see if this is required for your chosen resource, please look at Jet Admin's docs for that specific resource.
