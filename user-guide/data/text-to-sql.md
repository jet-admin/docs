You can access SQL queries and the Text-to-SQL function in the Data Editor in the left hand menu or when choosing a resource for a component.&#x20;

Then click on the Translate Text to SQL button, and describe the query that you want in the text box and click To SQL. After that, click on the Send Request button to see a preview of your query.

One of the most common errors in AI-generated SQL queries is incorrect field names. Jet Admin's built in Resource navigator will help you correct these, even if you aren't sure of the exact names yourself. Also, you will want to check that any values are correctly entered. In my example, the correct value is "Cash," but the generated value was "cash". Once I've corrected this, the query works perfectly.

When your query is working correctly, click the Save button.
