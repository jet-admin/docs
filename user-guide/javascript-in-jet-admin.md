# Javascript in Jet Admin

In this guide, we’ll be looking at some of the basic operations with JavaScript to help us understand how easy and fun building apps on Jet Admin:

* Using Javascript for Computed Columns and Binding Data
* Creating Custom Components using Javascript and HTML/CSS
* Data Transformation
* Load 3rd party libraries or run custom JavaScript for the current App



If you are new to Javascript, the following courses help you to fill the gap:
