# ðŸ’  Data Blending

Data blending allows you to **merge (join)** pieces of data from different (multiple) data sources. Typically, to do that, you'd need a data warehouse, but with Jet, you can do it without any additional software or services. You can also write **SQL with non-SQL** data sources.&#x20;

You can even layer the above capabilities to transform your data the way you want regardless of where it comes from.

{% hint style="info" %}
**All the data sources** you want to be able to blend from have to be connected through the "Sync connection"
{% endhint %}

## Sync Connection

While connecting a data source, you'll be prompted to choose the type of a connection, there could be a **direct connection** or a **sync connection**:

Choose the sync connection to unlock all the features listed above. Under the hood, it will use Jet Tables - Jet's built-in SQL database as the medium for syncing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the moment, the sync connection is available for a limited number of integrations. If you want us to prioritize a specific data source, please let us know in the support chat
{% endhint %}

## Blending the data

To demonstrate how the data blending works, we'll use two data sources: Airtable and Google Sheets, where the former contains the `Order` table and the latter - the `Customers` table. Notice that the `Customer ID` column in the `Orders` table refers to the `ID` in the `Customers` table.

Once you've connected your data sources (read more on particular integrations [**here**](integrations/)), proceed to the data section and pick a data source where you want to perform the blending _(you can choose either one, it's just a matter of convenience)_

Then create a new virtual collection:

You'll see all the data sources you've connected using "Sync" on the right. You can now pick the columns and use them in your query:

And after writing and running our query, we get the resulting table, containing `Full name` and `Country` columns from the `Customers` table together with the `Order Date` column from the `Orders` table.

After saving changes, we get a collection with joined data that we can later use in the interface.

## Sync options

The sync parameters can be changed in the **Sync options** tab. To get there, click the three dots in the top left corner of your data source page:

The syncing consist of two parts: the `Data source` - `Jet tables` connection (referred to as **External updates**) and the `Jet tables` - `Interface` connection (referred to as **Internal updates**). The latter pair is syncing in real-time while the former one's syncing interval can be changed

{% hint style="info" %}
At the moment, the external updates interval can only be set on the side of Jet Admin, so if you need to change it, reach out to client support
{% endhint %}

In the sync tab, you can:

* View the **status** (could be <mark style="color:green;">active</mark> or <mark style="color:yellow;">paused</mark>) (1)
* Control the sync: **pause it** or perform a **manual sync** - Sync now (2)
* View the **Internal updates interval** (3)
* View the **external updates interval** (4)
