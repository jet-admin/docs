# Invite by Email

In this case, people will not be able to access your app unless they are invited to your project by an administrator, and then logged in with an Invite link sent to their email.&#x20;

You can also choose the team that the user automatically joins as soon as he/she signs up and accepts the invitation.

To share your app by email, follow the steps:

1. Click on the `Share` button
2. Write the **email** you want to share the invite with&#x20;
3. Change the **Team**
4. Click on the `Send Invite` button

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the Invite link is valid for 24 hours. You will see all the users in your app in the Users tab.
{% endhint %}

As soon as the user follows the link in the email, he/she will see the following screen to accept the invitation to join the app:
