# Invite by Link

You can also choose the team that the user automatically joins as soon as he/she signs up and accepts the invitation. All users signed up through that link will automatically get into your application and exactly the team you picked.

To share your app by link, follow the steps:

1. Click on the `Share` button
2. Choose the **Team**
3. Click on the `Add Invite Link` button
4. Copy the Link and share it

{% @arcade/embed flowId="Dd0fCWBiy18YdJbIEQoW" url="https://app.arcade.software/share/Dd0fCWBiy18YdJbIEQoW" %}

As soon as the user follows the link, he/she will see the following screen to accept the invitation to join the app:
