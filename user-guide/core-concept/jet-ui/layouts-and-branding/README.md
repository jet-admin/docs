# App settings

**App settings** allow you to change the look-and-feel of the app and configure your app's parameters. You can find it in the left black bar in the builder mode.

**Hover your mouse** over the menu to open it up:

You'll see seven different tabs:

* **Appearance** - configure a color scheme and the layout of the app
* **Menu** - configure your app's menu, create sections and reorder the elements
* **App info** - set up the app's name and service URLs
* **Custom domain** - set up a custom domain for your app
* **Sign-up** - customize the sign-up page, add your logo, favicon, etc
* **Features** - additional features
* **Scripts & Styles** - add global JavaScript and CSS

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most of the settings changes take effect only in the User-mode, so to check the result, **preview or publish** your app (more on different modes [here](../../../preview-and-publish/))
{% endhint %}
