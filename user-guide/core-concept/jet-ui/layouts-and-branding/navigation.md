# Navigation

The navigation bar helps users find their way around your app. While in the builder mode, you can access all the pages. The great news is that Jet allows you to craft as many as three menus and combine them. And guess what, you can also personalize your navigation! Here's how you can do it:

1. Configure menu layout
2. Manage menu Items
3. Set up the menu background color

### Configure Menu Layout

There are two types of menu layouts **Vertical** and **Horizontal.** Each class has different visibility:

**Vertical  (Left positioning)**

* Thin width
* Wide width

**Horizontal (Top positioning)**

* Primary menu
* Secondary menu
* Inner menu â€“ if you would like to use a combination of a vertical and horizontal menu

### Configure Menu Colors

You can apply different colors to the menu background. Select menu -> click **Color**
