# Custom Scripts & Styles

**Scripts & Styles** allow you to set global JavaScript and CSS. **Global JavaScript** might come in handy for use-cases such as setting up a chat functionality in your app. **Global CSS** will allow you to customize the appearance of different UI components, but unlike page-specific CSS, the changes will apply to all the UI components of the same type. It might be helpful if you want to change the shape of all buttons in your app at once.

You can access them in this section of the App Settings menu.
