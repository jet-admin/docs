<summary>Internal Tools vs. Customer Portals</summary>

There are two streams of Jet Admin plans, each with its own billing options.

In both streams, the plans differ in premium and advanced features and other aspects, but a key difference is that the Internal Tools plans are billed per user. For other details about the differences between the plans, see the [Internal Tools](https://www.jetadmin.io/pricing/internal-tool) and [Customer Portals](https://www.jetadmin.io/pricing/portal) pricing pages.
