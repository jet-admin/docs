# Version Control

Version control allows you to version the applications you build and revert to a previous version if something broke or isn't functioning as intended.

### Creating a backup version

{% hint style="info" %}
At the moment, Jet doesn't have an automated backup system so you should save and store relevant versions manually
{% endhint %}

To save a stable version, open your app in the builder mode and click on the "App" icon in the top left corner

Then choose the environment you want to save the version from (click the gear icon to drill down)

After that, you can **download the current configuration** and store it in your local storage

### Restoring a previous version

To rollback to the previously saved version, you'll need to click upload and select the backup file that's been saved. After that, the changes will be pushed automatically
