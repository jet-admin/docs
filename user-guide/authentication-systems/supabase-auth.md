# Supabase Auth

## Pre-requisites

* **Supabase Account**: Ensure you have an active Xano account.
* **JetAdmin Account**: Similarly, a JetAdmin account is required. [Register](https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create) if you haven't already.
* **User Table in Supabase**: Set up a user table in your Supabase project. It is located at "**Authentication" -> "Users"**

## Setting up custom authentication

This example shows how to add an option to authenticate your Supabase users into JetAdmin. In this scenario, access management is done on the Jet Admin side.
