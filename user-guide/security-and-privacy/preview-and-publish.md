# Preview & Publish

There are three operational modes in Jet Admin: the **Builder mode**, **** the **User mode**, and the **Preview mode.**

**Builder mode** is where people, building an app can add data sources, drag-and-drop UI components, customize them, bind them to your data, manage environments, and perform all the necessary work to get your app ready.&#x20;

**User mode**, on the other hand, allows end-users to perform their operations in the app. In this mode, they don't have access to any customization features but can interact with the data according to their permissions.
