# Sharing your app

In JetAdmin you can choose how users will access your application: **Invite by email** or **Public Access via link**.

You can share your app by simply clicking on the `Share` button.

### Invite by Email

In this case, people will not be able to access your app unless they are invited to your project by an administrator, and then logged in with an Invite link sent to their email.&#x20;

[invite-by-email.md](../core-concept/sharing-your-app/invite-by-email.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Invite by Link

Invite by Link means that if anyone has the link to your app they can view it once they Sign Up.

{% content-ref url="../core-concept/sharing-your-app/invite-by-link.md" %}
[invite-by-link.md](../core-concept/sharing-your-app/invite-by-link.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
