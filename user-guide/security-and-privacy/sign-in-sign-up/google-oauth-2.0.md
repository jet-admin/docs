# Google SSO OAuth 2.0

If you want to use Google services such as Google Sheets, Google Drive, Google Cloud and many others, this step-by-step guide can help you with **Google OAuth 2.0** authentication.

Once you have created the project and selected the Rest API resource, you also selected the [OAuth 2.0](../../integrations/rest-api/oauth-2.0.md) authentication method - you need to select a provider.

## Google Developers Console

### 1. Google API Console

Visit the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials such as a `Client ID` and `Client secret` that are known to both Google and Jet Admin.

### 2. Create a new project

### 3. Specify new project details

Specify `Project name` and `Location` then click the **Create** button.

### 4. Enable APIs and Services

In the control panel, enable the API and Services you plan to use.&#x20;

The API library looks like this. You can choose any service you are plan to use, but we will go through the Google Sheet API.

Once you have selected the API and services, click the **Enable** button.

Choose how you want to configure and register your app, including your target users. You can only associate one app with your project. Then click **Create**.

Specify the application name, scroll down the page, and click **Save**.

Go to the credentials menu and click **Create credentials**. Then select OAuth Client ID.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (423).png>)

Then you need to select the application type. In the drop-down list, select Web application. Specify name, you also can add OAuth Redirect URL, then click **Create**.\

### 5. Adding resource

To complete the process of adding a resource, we need to fill in the scopes field.

You can find the necessary information [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#sheets). For our case, the scopes look like this.

| Scopes                                                | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets          | See, edit, create, and delete your spreadsheets in Google Drive |
| https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly | View your Google Spreadsheets                                   |

### Conclusion&#x20;

Congratulations! Now you are ready to authenticate with Google OAuth 2.0. If you still have any questions, please contact us for help.
