# API calls with SSO token

### Authorizing API calls to your backend with SSO token

When user is logged in with **SSO** it is possible to use **SSO access token** in **HTTP** queries (**Rest API** or **GraphQL**). Such requests are going through api.jetadmin.io endpoint or self-hosted **Jet Bridge** (when set up as [HTTP proxy](../../../jet-bridge-deployment/jet-admin/using-self-deployed-http-proxy.md)).

You can insert any **SSO tokens** in HTTP/GraphQL queries using **SSO credentials** section.
