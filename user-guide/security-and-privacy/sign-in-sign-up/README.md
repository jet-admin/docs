# Sign In/Sign Up

JetAdmin has a built-in **User Management System**. All invited users to your application ([invited by email](../sharing-your-app.md#invite-by-email), [invited by link](../sharing-your-app.md#invite-by-link)), will be available in the **Users** tab:

### Sign in/Sign up process

All invited users are automatically taken to the login page of your app. After signing up/logging in, the user will be redirected to your app and added to the Internal Users Management System.

The default authorization process involves authorizing in the following ways:

1. Google & Facebook authorization (basic SSO)
2. Authorization via credentials (login + password)

You can also implement your own authorization through SSO. See the topics in this section on implementing different SSO methods:

### User Management System

The built-in User Management System allows you to configure each user on a granular basis, as follows:&#x20;

1. **Specify user role**. Configure user's access to the application by setting a [specific role](../create-and-manage-a-team.md).
2. **Specify user properties**. Set properties for users to control their [permissions](../user-and-team-properties.md) and access to data.
3. **Sharing your app**. Invite your employees or customers to collaborate with your data. See [here](../sharing-your-app.md) for more details.
