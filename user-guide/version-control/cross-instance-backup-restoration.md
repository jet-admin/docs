**Important Notes**

* **JET\_BRIDGE\_CLOUD\_TOKEN**: This token is crucial when restoring a backup from a different Jet Admin instance. Ensure that you have this token ready before starting the restoration process.
* **Backup Compatibility**: Verify that the backup file is compatible with the instance you are restoring to, as differences in versions or configurations might affect the restoration.
