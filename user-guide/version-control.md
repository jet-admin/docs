# ðŸŽš Version Control

Version control allows you to version the applications you build and revert to a previous version if something broke or isn't functioning as intended.

By default, any changes made to a Jet app are automatically saved to the current working version and are immediately visible to all users. However, it is possible to enable app versioning or revert back to a previous state if necessary.

Releases enable users to implement app versioning and release changes using a unique version number that represents the app's specific state. When a release is published, it becomes the live version for users to interact with, providing a secure way to test and deploy changes without causing any disruptions.&#x20;

Jet keeps a detailed record of all modifications made, allowing users to browse through the list of versions and revert the app to a previous state if necessary.

### Creating a backup version

{% hint style="info" %}
At the moment, Jet doesn't have an automated backup system so you should save and store relevant versions manually
{% endhint %}

To save a stable version, open your app in the builder mode and click on the "App" icon in the top left corner

Then choose the environment you want to save the version from (click the gear icon to drill down)

After that, you can **download the current configuration** and store it in your local storage

### Restoring a previous version

To rollback to the previously saved version, you'll need to click upload and select the backup file that's been saved. After that, the changes will be pushed automatically
