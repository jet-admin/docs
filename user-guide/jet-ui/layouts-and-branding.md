# App settings

**App settings** allow you to change the look-and-feel of the app and configure your app's parameters. You can find it in the left black bar in the builder mode.

**Hover your mouse** over the menu to open it up:

You'll see seven different tabs:

* **Appearance** - configure a color scheme and the layout of the app
* **Menu** - configure your app's menu, create sections and reorder the elements
* **App info** - set up the app's name and service URLs
* **Custom domain** - set up a custom domain for your app
* **Sign-up** - customize the sign-up page, add your logo, favicon, etc
* **Features** - additional features
* **Scripts & Styles** - add global JavaScript and CSS

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most of the settings changes take effect only in the User-mode, so to check the result, **preview or publish** your app (more on different modes [here](../preview-and-publish.md))
{% endhint %}

### **Menu**

While in the builder mode you have access to all the pages, the pages (and links) visible in the user-mode are configured in this tab. You can add a new menu item **(1)**, regroup pages by dragging and dropping them **(2),** and change the item's icon **(3)**.&#x20;

### Scripts & Styles

**Scripts & Styles** allow you to set global JavaScript and CSS. Global JavaScript might come in handy for use-cases such as setting up a chat functionality in your app. Global CSS will allow you to customize the appearance of different UI components, but unlike local CSS, the changes will apply to all the UI components of the same type. It might be helpful if you want to change the shape of all buttons in your app at once.
