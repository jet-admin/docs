# ðŸ–¼ Import Figma Design

The Figma to Jet plugin lets you turn your static designs into clean, production-ready Jet components. Add Jet Interactions, wire up content using your data source, and one-click publish your fully functional web apps.\


### **Hereâ€™s how it works:**

1. **Install + connect.** Pass Figma Plugin key access to the Jet apps youâ€™ll use to transfer designs from Figma to Jet.
2. **Copy + paste.** Design with auto layout in Figma, then easily translate your designs to Jet as responsive components â€” you can apply pixel-perfect adjustments later.
3. **Polish + publish.** Bring your static designs to Jet, wire content with your data source, and one-click publish your fully functional web apps.

### **Additional features:**

* Auto layout enables responsive across varius devices.
* Your styling, layouts, colors, text, and images will transfer seamlessly when you paste them into Jet.

### What is not supported:

* Radial/Angular/Diamond gradients
* Masks
* Shapes (import as SVG at the moment)
* Custom border dashes
* Layer/Background blur
* Border join style

### **Workflow tips:**

* Pre-built layout and structure templates are built with auto layout and are fully responsive when pasted into Jet.
* All Vector layers will be exported as SVGs. This can be handy for complex multi-layer graphics.

### **Caveats and future improvements**

* The plugin doesnâ€™t translate prototyping interactions from Figma. Users can apply Jet Interactions after pasting designs over.
* The plugin doesnâ€™t transfer custom fonts. If youâ€™re using custom fonts in Figma, youâ€™ll need to move to Google Fonts before or after importing.
