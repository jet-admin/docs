# Auto Layout

You can use the Auto Layout feature in Frames.

There are a couple of settings:

* Auto layout direction:
  * Horizontal layout
  * Vertical layout
  * Horizontal wrap layout
  * Vertical wrap layout
* Gap (either Vertical or Horizontal, depending on direction)
* Padding (equal or independent)
* Layout stacking boundaries â€” one of nine options, dead center, off center, or at the corners
