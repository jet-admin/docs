# Component Responsiveness / Constraints

Create responsive components using Resizing. Resizing allows you to handle the positioning and sizing of user elements when the size of the canvas changes. You can apply resizing to Canvas or Element.

#### Resize Canvas

To resize the canvas, please follow the steps:

1. Click on the `Canvas` from the **Left sidebar**
2. To fix the width, go to the **Right sidebar** and click on the button&#x20;
3. To change the width, use the `W` button from the **Right sidebar**
4. To change the height, use the `H` button from the **Left sidebar**
5. To change the **opacity**, drag the button
6. Click on the `Corner radius` and specify it
7. Click on the button next to Corner radius to apply it equally

#### Resize Elements

Resizing is a dynamic and essential feature in design that enables components to adapt seamlessly to their content. For instance, buttons can expand with the text, and lists can grow as items are added. It can be applied to elements in Canvas to manage padding, spacing, and alignment, simplifying the process of making designs adaptive and responsive.

To resize the elements, please follow the steps:

1. From the **Right Sidebar**, click on the width button to fix it
2. From the **Right Sidebar**, click on the height button to fix it
