# Shadows

Shadows serve several purposes, from aesthetic to functional. They can enable you to signify that an element is interactive, like making a button look clickable by giving the layer a shadow to visually pop.

In Jet, shadows can be either outside, or inside. They can be a specific color and also have an alpha channel, and you can set a shadow location and blur.

Color can be selected via referencing a parameter.

To add a shadow, please follow the steps:

1. From the **Right Sidebar**, click on the `Add Shadow` button
2. Click to `Color` button to change the color of the shadow
3. Click on the `X-axis` to change it
4. Click on the `Y-axis` to change it
5. Click on the `Blur` button to change it
