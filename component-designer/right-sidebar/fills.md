# Fills

Paints are colors, gradients, or images. Fills are just one of the ways you can use paints in Jet.

Apply paints to text layers, or any vector object, this includes shapes, vector networks, and boolean groups. You can add, adjust, and remove fills in the **Fill** section of the right sidebar.

_Fill types (plain, image, icon, linear gradient, radial gradient, angular gradient, diamond)_

Color fill types can be set via formula and referenced from parameters. Press the "Color with Formula" button to set it up. It can be applied to plain colors and gradients.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not possible at the moment to set the opacity of the fill if the color was set via Formula. But you can set the opacity of the Layer.
