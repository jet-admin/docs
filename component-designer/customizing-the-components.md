# Customizing the components

**Component Designer** has five distinct areas:&#x20;

1. **Toolbar** – find tools to create frames, shapes, text, and other layers. These will be the building blocks of your designs.
2. **Parameters** – allow you to pass dynamic variables from your app to the component
3. **Left sidebar** – gives you access to layers. Explore any layers on the canvas.
4. **Canvas** – is your working area where you’ll arrange layers to create your designs. You’ll find lots of room to explore and iterate on your ideas.
5. **Right sidebar** – access more information about your designs. With a layer selected, you can explore the properties of your current selection.
