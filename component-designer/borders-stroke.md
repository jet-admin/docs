# Borders/Stroke

Strokes are a collection of properties you can apply to layers in design files. You can think of strokes as the visual representation of a vector path. Use stroke properties to:

* Add outlines around shapes, vector networks, or boolean operations
* Create lines and arrows
* Add borders to images
* Add strokes to individual sides of rectangular layers, like rectangles, frames, and components.

To add a border, please follow the steps:

1. From the **Right Sidebar**, click on the `Add` button&#x20;
2. Click on the **Type** of border, to change it
3. Select the type you want to apply
4. Click on the `Color` button, to change it
