# Apply shadow or blur effects

Effects serve several purposes, from aesthetic to functional. They can enable you to signify that an element is interactive, like making a button look clickable by giving the rectangle a shadow.

Blurs can shift and identify inactive or inaccessible elements, like thumbnails for unlocked game levels, or provide a visual hierarchy to focus a user's attention on a dialog box.

In Jet, there are four types of effects:

* Drop shadow
* Inner shadow
* Layer blur
* Background blur

Jet lets you add eight of each shadow effect, and one of each blur effect to a selection.

To add a shadow, please follow the steps:

1. Click on the `Add Shadow` button
2. Click to `Color` button to change the color of the shadow
3. Click on the `X-axis` to change it
4. Click on the `Y-axis` to change it
5. Click on the `Blur` button to change it
