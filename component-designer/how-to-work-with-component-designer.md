# How to work with component designer

**Component Designer** has six distinct areas:&#x20;

1. **Toolbar** – find tools to switch between selection and hand, and also to create [frames](frames-and-groups.md), shapes, text, images and [action components](action-components.md). These will be the building blocks of your designs.
2. **Parameters** – allow you to pass dynamic variables from your app to the component ang change states
3. **Actions** – trigger actions on the page, outside of your component
4. **Layers sidebar** – gives you access to layers.
5. **Canvas** – is your working area where you’ll arrange layers to create your designs. You’ll find lots of room to explore and iterate on your ideas.
6. [**Right sidebar**](right-sidebar/) – access more information about your layers. With a layer selected, you can explore the properties of your current selection.
