# Interactions

Jet Admin's Component Designer allows you to add interactions to layers, enhancing user engagement and functionality. Five types of interactions can be added to any layer:

1. **Track Hover State:**
   * Monitors the hover state of the layer, allowing you to change its appearance or behavior when a user hovers over it.
2. **Track Pressed State:**
   * Detects when a layer is pressed or clicked, enabling you to modify its appearance or trigger specific actions.
3. **Click Action:**
   * Defines an action to be performed when the layer is clicked, such as navigating to another page or executing a custom script.
4. **Cursor:**
   * Customizes the cursor style when hovering over the layer, enhancing the user interface and experience.
5. **Text Selection:**
   * Allows text layers to be selectable, enabling users to copy text from your application.

**Usage Examples**

1. **Hover State:**
   * Change the background color of a button when a user hovers over it to provide visual feedback.
2. **Pressed State:**
   * Trigger an effect when a button is pressed to simulate a realistic button press.
3. **Click Action:**
   * Set up navigation to a detailed view when an image or item is clicked.
4. **Cursor:**
   * Change the cursor to a pointer to indicate clickable elements or to a custom icon for specific interactions.
5. **Text Selection:**
   * Enable users to copy text from informational panels or data tables for convenience.
