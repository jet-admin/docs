# Action components

You can use Jet components within your custom component designs, just the same as you can use them on the pages.

List of supported components:

* Button
* Button group
* Dropdown
* Text Field
* Checkbox
* Link to record
* Select
* Multiple Select
* Radio Button
* Date & Time
* Time

The settings for action components are the same as they are for the page components.
