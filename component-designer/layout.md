# Layout

**The layout** allows you to do the following operations:

* Adjusting Position (X and Y Coordinates)
* Modifying Width and Height
* Rotating elements
* Adjusting Corner Radius
* Flipping vertically over their X-axis and horizontally over the Y-axis
* Set Element Opacity
* Blend modes (allow you to define how you want two layers to blend)

To make changes in the design, follow the steps:

1. From the **Right Sidebar,** change the X-axis
2. Below the X-axis, you can find the **W** button; you can change the width there
3. Next to it, you can find the **H** button; you can change the height there
4. Next to it, you can change the flip horizontally or vertically&#x20;
