# Fills

Paints are colors, gradients, or images. Fills are just one of the ways you can use paints in Jet.

Apply paints to text layers, or any vector object, this includes shapes, vector networks, and boolean groups. You can add, adjust, and remove fills in the **Fill** section of the right sidebar.
